# LeaderBoard APIS Project

> In this project I set up JavaScript for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. Then I consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
